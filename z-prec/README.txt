This is a text to determine the precision of internal Z interpolation. The idea is to see how small of a gradient the rasterizer of the GS can produce, which will give the internal precision. We draw a bunch of horizontal lines with different gradients in Z by making one end of the line have Z=0 and the other end have a value of Z1 (different for each line). We make the lines 1024 pixels wide so that the gradient is Z1 / 1024. If the GS has n internal bits of precision then all lines with gradients less than  1 / 2^(n+1) should be essentially flat (assuming the GS interpolates horizontally in one line, which is debatable).
