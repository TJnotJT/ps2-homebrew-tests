This is for testing what happens on a PS2 with huge ST values. We draw texture triangles where one of the points has huge ST values.

After running this on actual hardware, it seems like the huge values are properly clamped to the correct corner of the texture based of the sign of the huge value. Note that the PS2 does not support infinities, so huge values are always finite.
